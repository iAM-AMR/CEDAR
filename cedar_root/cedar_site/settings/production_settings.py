# DEBUG is specified using an environment variable, and should be False in production.

# Environment variables are read as strings, but DEBUG must be set using a boolean. So 
# create a boolean from the string by evaluating the equality of 'true' and the contents 
# of environment variable DEBUG (which returns 'False' if not specified). Use .lower to
# ensure true, True, and TRUE are equivalent.

# ALLOWED_HOSTS is list of strings representing the host/domain names that this 
# Django site can serve. Default: [] (Empty list). When DEBUG is True and 
# ALLOWED_HOSTS is empty, the host is validated against ['.localhost', '127.0.0.1', '[::1]'].
# When DEBUG is False, ALLOWED_HOSTS must be set. Else, all requests are returned
# as 400 Bad Requests.

# Environment variable ALLOWED_HOSTS is a string of IP addresses, FQDNs, or 
# '.' wild-cards, seperated by a space.

# -------------------------------------

# See comments in base settings re: static files. The following are defined
# in base settings:
#  - STATIC_URL (the URL to use when referring to static files located in STATIC_ROOT)

# STATIC_ROOT is the absolute path to the directory where collectstatic() will 
# collect static files for deployment.
# See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#collectstatic
